# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUser(-1)
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
The function is not safe since it log out the users data and it is easy to get called by other people.
The function does not handle cases where the userId is invalid (e.g., -1). The API might return a 404 Not Found status, but the function does not check the response status before attempting to parse the JSON. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
The function also didn't check the status of the response or handling any errors.
