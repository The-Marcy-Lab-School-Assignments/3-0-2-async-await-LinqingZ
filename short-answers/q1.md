# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

`async`/`await` is more clear in the way of the data and function calling. It is more readable that you don't need to make it write `.then` every time you go function calling or data calling. It is hard to keep track of the callback in the `.then`. Error handling with `async`/`await` is more straightforward using `try`/`catch` blocks, which are familiar from synchronous code. In `.then`, you always need to return a promise if you get something from to pass to the next `then`, but the varible is only can used inside the `then`. But `async`/`await` can much easy on data reuse.
